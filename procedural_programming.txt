Programming Paradigm
- a style of Programming
- There are several types of paradigms, the three most popular are:
    - Procedural
    - Object-Oriented
    - Functional

Procedural Programming
- programming style
- where you write a sequence of steps moving towards a solution with each step, changing the program state
- in Procedural, you write code to:
        do("this")
    then:
        do("that")

Example of Procedural programming
x = 2 # define x
y = 4 # define y
z = 8 # define z
xyz = x + y + z # define the value of xyz
print(xyz) # results in 14

When you prgram procedurally, you store data in global variables

authors = []    # global variables

# manipulate with functions
def collect_authors():
    answer = None
    while answer != "q":
        answer = input("Who is your favorite author? ")
        authors.append(answer)

print(authors)

Procedural programming is fine when building small programs. Once programs become larger, issues will arise. 
For example, when you program becomes larger, it needs to keep track of more data. Which means you need to make 
more global variables. At a certain point, it makes it hard to keep track of all the global variables. 
It will lead to unexpected errors. 

Side Effects 
- When you change the state of a global variable. 

The issues with procedural programming lead to the discovery of Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming.
